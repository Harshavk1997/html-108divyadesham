In India, they are spread across the states of Tamil Nadu (84), Kerala (11), Andhra Pradesh (2), Gujarat (1), Uttar Pradesh (4), and Uttarakhand (3). Muktinath, Saligramam is the only Divya Desam in Nepal. The Divya Desams are revered by the 12 Alvars in the Naalayira Divya Prabandham, a collection of 4,000 Tamil verses. The Divya Desams follow either Tenkalai or Vadakalai modes of worship.</p>

Each time his lock of hair touched the ground, there were eleven other forms of Shiva who appeared. The celestial deities were worried that if the dance continues, it would result in the decimation of all of creation. They prayed to Vishnu for help, who appeared at this place. On seeing Vishnu, Shiva's anger reduced, and he requested Vishnu to appear in eleven forms like he had. On his request, Vishnu appeared in eleven different forms at Tirunangar. The eleven places where Vishnu appeared are believed to be where the eleven temples in Tirunangar are located.
